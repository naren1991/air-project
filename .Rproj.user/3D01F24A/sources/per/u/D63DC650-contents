## Characterisitcs of the architecture

* There are building blocks and operators
* Combinations of building blocks and operators form first principles
* First principles are combined to understand a particular phenomenon
* Each first principle is represented by a model
* When a new situation is encountered, we try to combine first principles to form a model
* If it can't, then we spawn a new first principle

# A simple experiment

* Task - Teach addition
* Start with no knowledge
* We consider just numbers

## New model

```{r}

```


## Baseline model

## Comparison and results
